  /* Why is “now” appearing twice?

Because DevTools shows:
	•	The function as a standalone entry (aggregated total time)
	•	The same function nested inside its parent call

It’s not the same entry repeated.
It’s two different perspectives of the same execution slice.

Think of it like:

“Show me all time spent in now()” */

/* 

Why does expanding Event: DOMActivate show Event: DOMActivate inside?

Because events internally dispatch through layers.

The browser fires:

Event → internal dispatch → handlers → possibly another event

So DevTools shows:
	•	The outer dispatch
	•	The inner processing

Explain the topic that you just learned to yourself as if you were 5 years old.

Navigation story
When we type text in the rectangle in our browser app, there is a guy called UI thread who recieves it.

When UI thread receives it he notices what we want but he has to fly to get what we want.

Since he doesnt have wings he calls another guy called network thread to help him get the text for him since he has wings.

So he gives it Network thread and network flies off to get his text.

Network reaches there and gets the text, he also checks whether it is the right text for UI thread.

Network comes back and gives the text to UI thread and UI thread is happy with the text.

Since UI thread is just a worker, he has to give it to his boss.

When UI gives to his boss browser process, browser process gives it to someone else called renderer process. Renderer process then shows us what we see on the screen.

If we click on another link on the page, renderer process sends it back to the boss browser process and the whole process goes on again and again.

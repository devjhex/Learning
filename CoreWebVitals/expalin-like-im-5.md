## LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
Imagine you open a book and wait for the biggest picture to show up. LCP is how fast that big picture appears!

## INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
You press a button and wait for something to happen, like a light turning on. INP is how fast the page shows you something after you press the button!

## CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
You're reading a story and suddenly the words jump around because someone added a new picture. CLS is how much the page moves and surprises you!

NOTE:
CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) is measured as a number (score) between 0 and 1.

0 means nothing moved
1 means everything jumped a lot

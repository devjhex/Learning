# Core Web Vitals - Key Concepts

## LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- How fast does the biggest visible content (main image, heading, etc.) load?

## INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- How quickly does the page respond visually after any user interaction (click, tap, keypress)?

## CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- How much does the page unexpectedly move or shift while loading or interacting?

**Summary:**
- LCP = Loading speed of main content
- INP = Responsiveness to user actions
- CLS = Visual stability (no unexpected shifts)
- FID = First input responsiveness (now replaced by INP)
